                    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
                    <p>This Refund Policy ("Policy") outlines the terms and conditions under which Kitsune Technologies LLC ("Kitsune," "we," "us," or "our") provides refunds for purchases made through our website and services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

                    <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
                    <p>All sales of virtual items, digital content, and services on Kitsune are final. We do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges for any purchases, except as explicitly stated in this Policy or as required by applicable law.</p>

                    <h2>2. Exceptions for Refunds</h2>
                    <p>Refunds may be considered in the following exceptional circumstances, at our sole discretion:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technical Errors:</strong> If a purchase was made due to a verifiable technical error on our part that resulted in an unintended or duplicate transaction, and the purchased item/service was not delivered or used.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unauthorized Transactions:</strong> If an unauthorized transaction occurred on your account, and you report it to us immediately with sufficient evidence, we may investigate and, if appropriate, issue a refund.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Where a refund is required by law in your jurisdiction.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
                    <p>To request a refund based on the exceptions above, you must contact our support team at support@playkitsune.lol within 7 days of the transaction date. Your request must include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your Kitsune account username.</li>
                        <li>The transaction ID or order number.</li>
                        <li>A detailed explanation of the reason for the refund request.</li>
                        <li>Any supporting evidence (e.g., screenshots, error messages).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Refund Process</h2>
                    <p>If a refund is approved, it will typically be processed within 10-14 business days. The refund will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. Please note that it may take additional time for the refund to appear on your statement, depending on your bank or payment provider.</p>

                    <h2>5. No Refunds for Used or Consumed Items</h2>
                    <p>Once virtual items or digital content have been used, consumed, or transferred from your account, they are no longer eligible for a refund under any circumstances.</p>

                    <h2>6. Chargebacks</h2>
                    <p>Initiating a chargeback or dispute with your payment provider without first contacting Kitsune support to resolve the issue may result in the suspension or termination of your account.</p>

                    <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
                    <p>This Refund Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

                    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify or update this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Policy on our website. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
