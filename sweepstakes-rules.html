                    <h1>Official Sweepstakes Rules</h1>
                    <p>These Official Sweepstakes Rules ("Rules") govern all sweepstakes, contests, and promotions ("Sweepstakes") offered by Kitsune Technologies LLC ("Kitsune," "we," "us," or "our") on our website and services (collectively, the "Service"). By participating in any Sweepstakes, you agree to be bound by these Rules.</p>

                    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>Sweepstakes are open only to individuals who are at least 18 years of age or older at the time of entry and are legal residents of jurisdictions where such Sweepstakes are permitted by law. Employees, officers, and directors of Kitsune Technologies LLC, its affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, and their immediate family members are not eligible to participate.</p>

                    <h2>2. How to Enter</h2>
                    <p>Entry methods will be specified in the individual Sweepstakes announcement. No purchase is necessary to enter or win. A purchase will not increase your chances of winning.</p>

                    <h2>3. Prize(s)</h2>
                    <p>The prize(s) for each Sweepstakes will be clearly described in the individual Sweepstakes announcement. Prizes are non-transferable and no substitution will be made except as provided herein at Kitsune's sole discretion. Kitsune reserves the right to substitute a prize for one of equal or greater value if the designated prize should become unavailable for any reason.</p>

                    <h2>4. Winner Notification</h2>
                    <p>Winners will be notified by email or through the Service within a specified period after the drawing. Winners may be required to complete and return an affidavit of eligibility, liability release, and where lawful, a publicity release within a specified time period to claim their prize.</p>

                    <h2>5. Odds of Winning</h2>
                    <p>The odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received for each Sweepstakes.</p>

                    <h2>6. General Conditions</h2>
                    <p>Kitsune reserves the right to cancel, suspend, and/or modify any Sweepstakes, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures, or any other factor beyond Kitsune's reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Sweepstakes, as determined by Kitsune in its sole discretion.</p>

                    <h2>7. Release and Limitations of Liability</h2>
                    <p>By participating in a Sweepstakes, entrants agree to release and hold harmless Kitsune Technologies LLC and its subsidiaries, affiliates, advertising and promotion agencies, partners, representatives, agents, successors, assigns, employees, officers, and directors from any liability, illness, injury, death, loss, litigation, claim, or damage that may occur, directly or indirectly, whether caused by negligence or not, from (i) such entrant's participation in the Sweepstakes and/or his/her acceptance, possession, use, or misuse of any prize or any portion thereof; (ii) technical failures of any kind, including but not limited to the malfunction of any computer, cable, network, hardware, or software, or other mechanical equipment; (iii) the unavailability or inaccessibility of any transmissions, telephone, or Internet service; (iv) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the entry process or the Sweepstakes; (v) electronic or human error in the administration of the Sweepstakes or the processing of entries.</p>

                    <h2>8. Disputes</h2>
                    <p>These Rules shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or related to these Rules or any Sweepstakes shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Missouri.</p>

                    <h2>9. Privacy</h2>
